# You can configure a regular expression to match the topic name against.
# The first [[topic]] stanza that matches, decides what happens, so put
# stanzas with more specialized regexen first. I'm doing this wrong here,
# but I want to explain the most basic [[topic]] stanzas first.
#
# Match groups will be converted to Prometheus keywords.
#
# The special group '__metric__', if present, will denote the metric name and
# NOT be added as a keyword.
#
# If match is not given, or the regex does not return a __metric__ group,
# the topic name will be split at / and the last part will be used for
# the metric name.
#
match  = 'sensor/(?P<sensor_name>\w+)/(?P<__metric__>\w+)'
#
# This regex will convert a topic such as this:
#
#    sensor/garage/temperature
#
# into a Prometheus metric such as this one:
#
#    temperature{mqtt_topic="sensor/garage/temperature",sensor_name="garage"}
#
# so then you can use the sensor_name as a filter in your PromQL queries.
